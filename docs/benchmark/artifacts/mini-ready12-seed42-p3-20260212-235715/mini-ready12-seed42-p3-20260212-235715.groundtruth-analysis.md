## Coverage / Reliability Diagnostics

| Study | Timesteps | Primary coverage |
|---|---:|---:|
| apple-att-privacy | 8 | 90.0% |
| bud-light-boycott | 10 | 98.3% |
| london-ulez-expansion-2023 | 6 | 99.2% |
| netflix-ad-tier-launch | 6 | 100.0% |
| netflix-password-sharing | 11 | 100.0% |
| nyc-congestion-pricing | 6 | 99.2% |
| plant-based-meat | 7 | 93.3% |
| reddit-api-protest | 12 | 97.5% |
| snapchat-plus-launch | 10 | 98.3% |
| spotify-price-hike | 10 | 100.0% |
| threads-launch | 10 | 92.5% |
| x-premium-adoption | 12 | 97.5% |

Interpretation:
- Misses on `threads` and `nyc` are mostly behavioral (coverage is high enough that denominator alone does not explain 9.2pp and 28.3pp misses).
- Lower coverage studies (`apple`, `plant`, `threads`) should still be stabilized in 5-seed reporting, but only `threads` is currently an accuracy miss.

## Miss Triage

1. `nyc-congestion-pricing` (largest miss): model over-shifts behavior away from driving.
2. `threads-launch`: model over-predicts sustained active use and under-predicts trial-and-abandon.

## Recommendation Before 5-Seed

Proceed with 5-seed on all 12 (to separate noise from signal), but treat these as priority watch studies:
1. `nyc-congestion-pricing`
2. `threads-launch`
